I wanted to know how this organization managed to create a culture that embodies the idea of ​​customer service.  Why are you so sad? - Well, I don't know ...  Let's say what happens if I am late for work, if I refuse to cooperate with others,if I don’t enter into Win / Win performance agreements with my people, if I don’t hold them accountable for achieving the desired results, or if I don’t support their professional growth and development of their careers?
